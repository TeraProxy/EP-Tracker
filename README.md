# EP-Tracker
A tera-proxy module that shows you information about your Enhancement Points experience, including the daily softcap.  
This is a fork of Owyn's original talents_info.

## Usage
**By opening the ingame EP menu** you will get an EP status report, including: Level, used and total EP, experience and daily softcap.  
**On gaining EP experience** in any form, the module will let you know how much experience you exactly got and how much is left until you only get a reduced amount for the rest of the day.  
  
While in game, open a proxy chat session by typing "/proxy" or "/8" in chat and hitting the space bar.  
This serves as the script's command interface.  
The following commands are supported:  
  
* **ep** - shows a report about your EP level, EP experience and the daily softcap

## Safety
Whatever you send to the proxy chat in game is intercepted client-side. The chat is NOT sent to the server.

## FAQ
**Q.** - Why does the module show a different level than the ingame menu?  
**A.** - The game doesn't actually show your real level, only the EP. Check this document for more info: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTy7_5TYA_WUd--cFqYeGFm0mnb9oaCzcar3yH3FgkQD6y-mRD7id9k97ttrMbkjjId8ly-aBWzexZt/pubhtml?gid=5547005

**Q.** - Why is my daily experience not 0 even though I didn't do anything yet?  
**A.** - The daily EP experience resets once per day at a specific time. When exactly depends on your server.

**Q.** - Why does the daily softcap in the module not match what's written in that document?  
**A.** - After 89% of your daily softcap you already start to gain a reduced amount of EP experience. Check this document for more info: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16wuje8nV7yYd0y2gq3oVFbjpR2Ulx4SQRWQQkK-LVrs
